        <h3>Bold Beginning</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>
            On Friday, September 22, 1944, under the inspired leadership of
            Gladys Hinson, National Children’s Home of the Assemblies of God
            opened to redeem homeless, neglected, orphaned, maltreated or
            otherwise vulnerable foster children and youth. That bold beginning,
            in Hot Springs, AR, has become a sizeable, Christ-centered, licensed
            and accredited child welfare agency.

        <p>
          {" "}
          This ministry fittingly began in the heart of a thirteen-year-old
          girl. As just a young teen, Gladys Hinson was inspired to open an
          orphan care ministry somewhere someday. During her college years she
          surrendered her heart to God’s call to be an Assemblies of God
          missionary in China. She believed China would be the place of her
          ministry dream. In 1941, as she prepared her plans to depart there in
          mission, the disaster at Pearl Harbor struck and missionaries were not
          permitted to enter that land. God turned her impassioned dreams toward
          the orphan need in America. Her relentless pursuit launched a growing
          work spanning seven decades.

          The agency’s primary campus is located at 2325 Malvern Avenue in Hot

          Milton Davis was three years old when he came to Hillcrest. He and his
          two brothers were the first children in the home. Gladys Hinson
          regularly taught the children about Jesus and his love for them. One
          day, Milton said it was his day to go to the front steps to pick up
          the milk at the bottom of the steps. As he reached down, he heard a
          cry coming from a box. When he opened the box, he saw a newborn girl
          inside…crying. He took the box to Ms. Hinson. Together they named her
          Sharon Rose, after the ‘Rose of Sharon’ found in the Bible.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          Little Sharon would later be adopted. Little did Milton know that 64
          years later, he would have the privilege of sharing how she was found
          and gained her beautiful name. Never underestimate the impact of a
          single effort of mercy. It gives and gives.{" "}

        <h3>Foundational Past</h3>
        <p>
          {" "}
          National Children’s Home of the Assemblies of God began as a five-room
          single dwelling home with three small children. Within three months,
          the home increased to seventeen children and operated by using the
          garage apartment behind the home to house some of the children. To
          meet the growing need for additional housing, a request was sent out
          through the Assemblies of God fellowship of churches for assistance.
          In March of 1945 funds were provided to purchase an adjacent home with
          2.5 acres of property. It was referred to as the Oklahoma Unit and
          later as the Gotcher Cottage to house girls for the Home.{" "}
        </p>

        </div>

        <p>
          {" "}
          In the same year, the capacity of the second home was met and a new,
          two-story brick facility was planned. It would serve as a dormitory
          and dining hall for a number of years.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          In 1951, seven additional acres of land was purchased to expand the
          garden and farming land for the home.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          As the work grew, the need for staff housing increased. An additional
          cottage, named Hardcastle, was built in 1952. Although used initially
          for staff, it transitioned to house teen residents.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          In time, a new Hardcastle home was raised. It currently serves as a
          home for teen girls.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          In the same year the original barn was built to serve two purposes.
          The lower level was used as a dairy for the home’s herd and the upper
          level was a gym where the kids could play even on rainy days. In 1987,
          the barn was remodeled to house a laundry facility and a woodshop. It
          is still used today as a maintenance woodshop and workshop. The lower
          level is a storage and repair facility for tractors, mowers, vehicles
          and equipment.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          As the program grew, so did the need for more housing for referred
          children. In 1958, the Burris Cottage was purchased along with its
          4-acre tract of land. It was first used as a foster home for preschool
          boys and girls. Today, it serves as staff housing.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          The original Garrison Cottage was built in 1960 as a home for teen
          boys. It was later leveled, and a new Garrison Cottage was raised in
          1998. The home currently serves girls.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          In 1971 plans were drawn to construct a two-story housing facility.
          Construction began in 1973 and upon completion the 13,556 square foot
          building was named the Anderson Cottages I & II. It was originally
          used to house elementary boys. The facility was renovated in 2006 for
          the relocated Highlands Maternity Home and Life Center program when it
          moved to Hillcrest from Kansas City, MO. Highlands is now located in a
          newer home on campus. Today, the Anderson Cottages provide homes for
          two large sibling groups until permanency can be established for them
          either through reunification with family or through adoption.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          In 1991, the Gotcher Cottage no longer met agency standards, so plans
          were drawn up to construct two new cottages; one to replace the old
          cottage, and a second home to meet the need of increasing referrals.
          The first was constructed that same year and identified as the Anthony
          Cottage. By September of 1992, resources provided for construction of
          the second home, named as the Netzel Cottage. These cottages have been
          improved and renovated in recent years. The cottages serve young and
          teen boys respectively.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          In 2008, two additional cottages were approved for construction and
          they were completed. Today, the Wilmoth Cottage is a Highlands
          Maternity Home for minor girls and their babies. The Gilliam Cottage
          was recently assigned to provide a home for traumatized autistic
          foster children beginning the fall of 2019.{" "}

          Today there are eight cottage homes comprising Hillcrest Children’s
          Home. In order of completion date they are – Garrison, Hardcastle,
          Anderson I, Anderson II, Netzel, Anthony, Wilmoth, and Gilliam. Each
          cottage is licensed to house five to eight residents, depending on
          program of need.{" "}

          {" "}
          In 1965 a beautiful worship chapel was raised on campus overlooking a
          pond. The chapel serves regular resident gatherings, special services,
          holiday gatherings, trainings, and staff services. There is a
          two-bedroom staff apartment beneath the chapel. The facility was
          greatly updated, while maintaining its classic chapel design, in the
          summer of 2014. Upgrades in furniture, fixtures, sound and video
          technology gave the facility a vibrant new life.{" "}

        <p>
          {" "}
          The current campus includes other buildings serving lifestyle,
          recreational, and professional provision. In 1978 the Doyle Burgess
          gymnasium was constructed for activities such as basketball and
          volleyball. It also features an indoor pool. In 2018, a wonderful
          renovation was completed through a gift by Ms. Edwardene Johnson in
          honor of her parents, Edward & Bonnie Swain, to insure the value of
          this facility for another generation of deserving children and youth.
          The Warehouse Store is located in this facility. The free store
          provides new clothing, footwear, toys, toiletries, and other amenities
          of need for residents.{" "}

          The 5,900 square foot Emanuel E. Murry Dining Hall and Food Services
          facility was dedicated in 1982. The facility has a professional
          kitchen and dining hall for large gatherings and meals with a cozy
          fireplace. There is a large food warehouse for refrigerated, frozen,
          and other goods. Originally the dining facility provided most daily
          meals on campus. Today, most meals are served family-style in the
          resident homes. Yet, for a few meals each week, and more often during
          summer months, the dining hall is alive with community, family, and
          friends. The hall has been improved with new flooring, stainless steel
          furnishings, HVAC and more over the past five years.{" "}

          In 1998, the new 24,800 square foot, three-story James Bridges
          Ministry Center was erected on the front of the property. The lower
          level provides outstanding clinical services for physical health and
          social programs, including professional offices and meeting space. The
          second level serves as the welcoming lobby from the main parking lot
          and houses primary administrative offices and a large conference room.
          The top level provides eight apartments for resident staff and guests.
          In 2016 a new commercial quality roof was installed, and other

          original buildings. The same facility served as administrative offices
          until construction of the Bridges Center. The arts have been moved to
          homes and the gymnasium facility. The building has been renovated and
          serves as the on-campus counseling center to bring mental health and
          healing to residents. A fitting brick pavilion with fireplace was

        </p>
        <p>

          The initial program was a children’s home originally named, The
          National Children’s Home of the Assemblies of God. In 1960 the home
          was renamed as Hillcrest Children’s Home. Hillcrest was established to
          serve the needs of children who generally would return to their
          families after their time at the home. Although many children have
          been adopted through the years via its relationship with Highlands
          Child Placement Center.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          Early on some adoptable children moved from Hillcrest Children’s Home
          to Highlands Child Placement Center in Kansas City, Missouri to find
          adoptive families. The Highlands program operated in Missouri until
          2006 when it relocated to the Hillcrest campus. Highlands Maternity
          Home for Minors continues at Hillcrest and provides ministry to
          pregnant unwed teens and their babies in need.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          Both the Hillcrest and Highlands ministries operated under the
          direction of the Benevolence Department of the Assemblies of God based
          in Springfield, MO until 2005. A decision was then made to consolidate
          the programs under a new 501c3 non-profit corporation to be located on
          the existing Hillcrest campus in Hot Springs, AR. By 2006 the new
          parent corporation for Hillcrest and Highlands was established as
          Assemblies of God Family Services Agency (AGFSA) Inc.
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          During the summer of 2013, AGFSA rebranded under a new d/b/a (“doing
          business as”), COMP
          <span className="act">ACT</span> Family Services, to highlight and
          advance its work of compassionate action to redeem vulnerable children
          and families to the glory of God. The ministry is thus legally known

        <h3>A Bright Present and Bold Future </h3>
        <p>
          {" "}
          The 75-year history of this ministry, which began as National
          Children’s Home of the Assemblies of God (later named Hillcrest
          Children’s Home), has a great history and is ripe for much more. In
          1966, Highlands Maternity Home and Child Placement Services of the
          Assemblies of God joined the cause. In 2006, both ministries converged
          under a new nonprofit national affiliate of the General Council of the
          Assemblies of God known as Assemblies of God Family Services Inc.,
          d/b/a COMP
          <span className="act">ACT</span> Family Services. Since that time,
          approximately 9,000 children and families have been served resulting
          in more than 3,000 adoptions.
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          Since 2012, the ministry has been on a transformative journey as
          AGFSA, d/b/a COMP
          <span className="act">ACT</span> toward the fulfillment of its
          commissioned purpose providing residential and community-based
          professional Christian family services. That same year, the agency
          invested in a national landscape study of Assemblies of God church
          readiness to meet the American foster care crisis. Among the many
          findings of that first of its kind study, was 47% of the pastors
          saying that they would make foster care support a top three priority
          for their church if they “knew what to do” and “how to do it.” COMP
          <span className="act">ACT</span> was once again confronted to fulfill
          its commission as a national, not just regional, ministry.
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          By July 2015, the agency established a Residential Treatment program
          to minister healing and hope to some of the more vulnerable children
          in this world.
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          Recent trends and forces in American culture and child welfare laws
          have challenged this agency, as it has all agencies, both private and
          public. The agency made a commitment to exceed and lead a world class
          professional work while simultaneously holding to its Christ-centered
          programming and cause. To broaden its valuable experience and better
          serve the national crisis in child welfare through church education,
          competency, and empowerment, the agency published in manual forms its
          evidence-based compassion care system known as CompaCare. There is a
          System Manual, Family Advocate Manual, and a Volunteer Manual.
          Utilizing evidence-based data and veteran expertise, the system was
          introduced in August 2017 at the General Council in Anaheim, CA.{" "}

          CompaCare improves capacity, stability and quality for a foster care
          system in widespread crisis across the nation. The goal is to mobilize
          thousands of Assemblies of God and other embracing churches with
          CompaCare to meet, reach, and serve the generational challenge of
          family brokenness and suffering in America. Statistically in keeping
          with Scripture and data, the Assemblies of God churches alone should
          be ministering to approximately 20,000 foster children in America
          daily. CompaCare is the strategic way. Over a hundred leaders in
          sixteen states have been trained to date.{" "}

          CompaCare has been a faith venture founded from our core mission and
          vision. Since the fall of 2016, we’ve invested over $400,000 in its
          development including staff, consultancy, research, meetings and
          materials. It was the right venture. It has the potential for industry
          research projects that could extend its value in more ways than first
          imagined. Importantly, CompaCare is owned by COMP
          <span className="act">ACT</span> and can be mobilized at its
          discretion for ministry to vulnerable children and families for years
          to come. We can share it with partnering churches, districts and
          others at will. There is a national deployment plan, and the agency is
          seeking to fund it forward. America is facing a family brokenness
          crisis of unprecedented proportion. CompaCare can be a vital track to
          help redeem it.

          In 2017, the agency extended its continuum of ministry as a Private
          Licensed Placement Agency (PLPA) for foster care in Arkansas; as one
          of three agencies awarded as a first public/private agency venture for
          foster care in the state. We first plant CompaCare in a partnering
          church, then recruit foster families within, and then placements are
          made. The result is better outcomes with faster permanency. The
          program is succeeding and expanding.{" "}

          {" "}
          In February 2018 the federal government passed the most significant
          child welfare legislation in 50 years. It is called the Family First
          Prevention Services Act (FFPSA). It affects every child welfare
          provider. In short, FFPSA is driving toward foster care homes, except
          for the most traumatized or unique in need. Effective October 1, 2019
          no child in the federally partnered American Foster Care System under
          the age of thirteen will be allowed to live in group homes unless they
          are living with their numerous siblings or they are pregnant. They are
          to be placed in community-based foster homes. So, states and licensed
          agencies are scurrying to comply. If states do not comply, they suffer
          the loss of the matching federal child welfare funds that their
          programs depend upon. Agencies that have traditionally provided group
          homes for children and youth referred through the American foster care
          system must change or cease existence. Almost every group home in
          America has been serving children and youth in the foster care
          community. For example, in 1944 the first three placements at National
          Children’s Home of the Assemblies of God (Hillcrest Children’s Home)
          came from a court referral in the foster care system. Fortunately, the
          leadership of COMP
          <span className="act">ACT</span> foresaw the impending change as far
          back as 2013. In recognition of the impending trends and forces of
          change, COMP
          <span className="act">ACT</span> began wise preparations in advance
          such as national accreditation.
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          Only those youth thirteen to seventeen years of age who have suffered
          more trauma are eligible for placement in residential settings that
          are nationally accredited as a Qualified Residential Treatment Program
          (QRTP).{" "}

        <p>
          {" "}
          In 2018, the agency developed and piloted a new kinship navigator
          instrument named F.I.N.D. (Families, Individuals, Neighbors, and
          Devotees). FIND identifies blood and non-blood relatives and resources
          so that children removed from maltreated homes may find kinship care
          rather than foster care. The statistics on FIND are encouraging. The
          state of Arkansas asked COMP
          <span className="act">ACT</span> to pilot this kinship navigator
          service in Arkansas. The results are proof FIND works. For example,
          kids who have been spiraling through dozens of foster placements for
          years on end, are finding kinship family reunification via COMP
          <span className="act">ACT</span> FIND.

          Last year the leadership of COMP
          <span className="act">ACT</span> engaged in strategic planning with
          the StratOp resource developed by The Paterson Center. StratOp is
          recognized as a leading resource among institutions, businesses, and
          non-profits for strategic planning. We engaged mulitiple phases of
          StratOp that produced an overall plan, including a better CompaCare
          plan.

          The emergent combination of residential, placement, and community

          <span className="act">ACT</span> Family Services has made this agency

          On August 22, 2018 the agency was nationally accredited by the New
          York-based Council on Accreditation (COA) through 2022 before renewal.
          All of COMP
          <span className="act">ACT</span>
          ’s above noted programs and services fall under its COA accreditation.
          The timing could not have been more favorable. The new FFPSA
          legislation will impact all providers. Had COMP
          <span className="act">ACT</span> not sought and obtained COA
          accreditation, it would likely have had to forfeit much of its
          residential programs. Instead, the agency is poised to be a leader in
          many facets of FFPSA directives.

          {" "}
          The adjustments and improvements invested to these goals and outcomes

          {" "}
          In March 2019, the agency reopened an office for placement and
          community-based services in Springfield, MO. One of the unique works
          in Missouri, in combination with its CompaCare partnered churches, is
          its diversion strategy, an intervention and provision work to prevent
          kids from coming into foster care or being disrupted from existing
          foster placements. The strategic vision is to open licensed services
          in multiple states over the next decade as the Holy Spirit enables.

          The agency’s evidence-based and registered trademark compassion care
          system, CompaCare, is designed for churches to effectively serve more
          children, youth, and families in need. Today’s Hillcrest campus
          provides Sibling Care, Qualified Residential Treatment Program,
          Respite Care, and Transitional Living for emancipating foster youth.
          On campus individual, group and family counseling services are
          operative in partnership with licensed counselors. Recently, the
          agency was asked, and its executive board approved, to open a
          Hillcrest home dedicated to serving traumatized, autistic foster
          children. That program is scheduled to begin in the fall of 2019.

          In July 2019, COMP

          Over the past five years, COMP

          The growing continuum of ministries is faithfully serving the growing
          need. Almost 140 children and youth were served in the first half of
          2019. Cumulatively that represents approximately one million hours of
          direct care. Thousands of hours of mentoring and counseling were
          rendered. COMP
          <span className="act">ACT</span> served hundreds of thousands of
          meals, thousands of medical appointments, medicines or first aid,
          thousands of articles of clothing, scores of tutoring, and much more.
          Many children and youth found permanency through family reunification
          or adoption. These services were lovingly provided in the name of
          Jesus Christ. Many persons have been healed and redeemed to the glory
          of God.
