        <p className="lead">
          There is a big difference between hopes/dreams and goals. These next
          two lessons will help identify key goals for our lives and help us
          create a life plan that serves to help reach those goals.

        <p className="h3">WHAT IS A LIFE PLAN?</p>

        <p>
          A Life Plan is a LIVING document that is created by an individual to
          help them ASSESS where they are in life, prioritize GOALS and
          responsibilities, and outlines specific ACTION steps to achieving
          goals and maintaining those priorities.
        </p>
        <p>Let’s break that down. A Life Plan…</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Is living – this means that it is constantly being edited by the
            creator to navigate life’s ups and downs while maintaining
            consistent focus
          </li>
          <li>
            Assesses your current life – this means that you have to be willing
            to take a brutally honest look at your life and admit to areas where
            you need improvement
          </li>
          <li>
            Prioritizes goals and responsibilities – this means that you will
            have to dare to dream while also taking control of your life. Goals
            are dreams and should not be easily achievable. Good goals require
            work. At the same time, though, it is important to take ownership of
            your life (the good and the bad) and maintain your responsibilities
            while reaching towards your goals
          </li>
          <li>
            Outlines action steps – this will require work. While we never want
            to “settle” in life, it is also important to be realistic in the
            goals that you set by making sure you can take specific steps to
            reach those goals.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p className="h3">WHY MAKE A LIFE PLAN?</p>

        <p>
          As a parent, it is IMPORTANT to create a Life Plan to help keep you on
          track when LIFE tries to distract you. Having a child, especially one
          who was a SURPRISE, can easily take your focus off the long term and
          leave you narrowly focused on the PRESENT.
        </p>

        <p>
          When you have a Life Plan, you should refer to it OFTEN to help ensure
          you are making choices that are leading you down your DESIRED
          life-path, down a path you DESIGNED and that you LOVE.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, life isn’t always that SIMPLE. Curveballs are inevitable
          and often throw us into a state of “SURVIVAL” or crisis-mode. When we
          are functioning this way, we often make POOR decision either out of
          haste or out of convenience without considering its FUTURE impact.
          This is where a Life Plan can help! A good Life Plan anticipates those
          CURVEBALLS and prepares you navigating DETOUR in a calm, thoughtful
          way.

          OVERWHELMED? Don’t worry, you DON’T have to do this alone! This
          training will walk you through making a great Life Plan for you and
          your children.
        </p>

        <p>
          Grab a journal (or find a device to type on), sit back, relax, and let
          this training (and the LORD) guide you through the PROCESS.
        </p>
        <p>
          IMPORTANT: Creating a Life Plan is NOT a 1 day event. It may take
          several days or weeks to finish your Life Plan. Take this TRAINING at
          your own pace and be sure to SEEK the Lord’s guidance as you go.
          Finally, don’t give up…the devil may try to DISCOURAGE you as you
          start creating a Life Plan. Take BREAKS as you need to but ALWAYS come
          back. Finish STRONG so your life can have a STRONG finish!{" "}

        <p className="h3">CREATING A LIFE PLAN</p>

        <p className="h4">STEP 1: Reflect and Assess</p>

        <p>
          When it comes to creating a Life Plan, it is{" "}
          <strong>IMPORTANT</strong> to start with an assessment of your current
          life. Often, this means <strong>REFLECTING</strong> on your childhood
          and <strong>RECOGNIZING</strong> not only where you are in life, but
          how you got there.
        </p>

        <p>
          For some of you, this part of the Life Planning process may be{" "}
          <strong>PAINFUL</strong>. Allow yourself to grieve, if needed, but
          don’t stay <strong>STUCK</strong> there. Reflection is a crucial part
          of <strong>LEARNING</strong>. Reflection helps us gain insight into
          our past and <strong>UNLOCKS</strong> things we may have originally
          missed or forgotten. It also allows us to incorporate GOOD things from
          our past into our Life Plan or create <strong>ALTERNATIVES</strong> to
          things that weren’t so good.
        </p>
        <p>
          Assessment is a second step of reflection. Without a life assessment,
          we can get <strong>STUCK</strong> in a rut, trapped by our routine and
          current situation in general. <strong>ASSESS</strong> both the good
          and the bad. Remember to assess a variety of aspects in your life such
          as how you spend your <strong>TIME</strong>, your best{" "}
          <strong>AND</strong> worst parts of the day, your strengths and
          weaknesses, etc.

      <Container className="my-5">
        <p className="h3">PRACTICE POINT</p>

        <p className="h4">Steps to Reflection and Assessment:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Get alone, away from ALL distraction (no cell phones, no internet,
            no tv, etc)
          </li>
          <li>
            Begin to think through (or write out) a NARRATIVE of your childhood
          </li>
          <li>
            As each memory passes through your mind (or is written on your
            paper), label it as something you would like to REPEAT or RE-ROUTE
            in your life
          </li>
          <li>
            Slowly begin making 2 lists in your Life Plan journal – Create a
            list of things you want to REPEAT from your childhood, either for
            yourself or for your child, and create a list of things you want to
            deliberately RE-ROUTE (not repeat) for yourself or your child
          </li>
          <li>
            Create a life ASSESSMENT list on the following page by answering the
            following questions
          </li>

          <ol>
            <li>
              What part of my day do I enjoy the most? What part of my day do I

            <li>What is going well in my life? What is not going well? Why?</li>
            <li>
              On a scale from 1-10, how would I rate my professional life,

        <p className="h3">CREATING A LIFE PLAN</p>

        <p className="h4">STEP 2: Goals</p>
        <p>
          Now that we have an IDEA of what we want to repeat from our past and
          what we don’t, it’s time to THINK about goals. A goal is a desired
          FUTURE outcome that a person COMMITS to achieve. The difference
          between a goal and a hope/dream/wish is that the person SETTING the
          goal COMMITS to the goal and puts ACTION STEPS in place to achieve it.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many DIFFERENT types of goals. There are personal goals,
          financial goals, parenting goals, relationship goals, health goals,
          career goals, educational goals, and spiritual goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Setting NUMEROUS goals in each one of these categories can get
          overwhelming quickly. We suggest picking 2 goals in each category.
          Once a goal is reached, REPLACE it with another one.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, remember to have 3-5 ACTION STEPS per goal so that the goal is
          broken down into manageable and attainable pieces.
        </p>
      </Container>
      <Container className="my-5">
        <p className="h3">PRACTICE POINT</p>

        <p className="h4">Steps to Goals:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            In your Life Plan journal, designate 8 pages to GOALS. The pages
            will be Personal Goals, Financial Goals, Parenting Goals,
            Relationship Goals, Health Goals, Career Goals, Educational Goals,
            and Spiritual Goals.
          </li>
          <li>On EACH page, write 2 goals that fit in that category.</li>
          <li>
            For each goal, write a TIME FRAME in which you would like to meet
            that goal. Ideally, this should be 1-5 years from right now.
          </li>
          <li>
            Under each goal, write 3-5 ACTION STEPS that you will take to meet
            that specific goal.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          **IF YOU AREN’T SURE WHAT GOALS TO SET, LOOK BACK AT YOUR
          REPEAT/RE-ROUTE PAGE FOR IDEAS**
        </p>
        <p>Here are questions to consider in each category:</p>
        <p>
          Personal Goals – What is a skill I would like to learn? What new habit
          would I like to develop? What habit would I like to get rid of? What
          value would I like to develop and how could I do that?
        </p>
        <p>
          Financial Goals – What debt do I have and how can I pay it off? How
          can I spend less every month? What things should I plan/save for? Will
          I financially be able to retire when I am old enough?
        </p>
      </Container>
      <Container className="my-5">
        <p>
          Parenting Goals – What tradition do I want to start with my kids? What
          do I want my house to look like/feel like/smell like/sound like? What
          discipline technique do I want to use more/less? Is there anything I
          want to make sure I teach my children?
        </p>

        <p>
          Relationship Goals – What kind of relationship do I want? What are
          non-negotiables in my next relationship? What boundaries can I put
          into place to protect my heart? What kind of partner do I want to be?
        </p>
        <p>
          Health Goals – What is a healthy habit I would like to develop? What
          change can I make to lead a healthier life? What is one thing I can do
          every day to improve my mental health?
        </p>
        <p>
          Career Goals – What is a passion of mine? What do I want my
          co-workers/boss to think of me? How can I do better/be more productive
          at work? Do I feel fulfilled?
        </p>
        <p>
          Educational Goals – What is something new I would like to learn? Are
          there classes in my local area that focus on topics in which I am
          interested? What kind of education do I need to get where I want to
          go? What is one new book I would like to read?
        </p>
        <p>
          Spiritual Goals – How can I have more peace in my life? Am I connected
          to a good church? Do I talk with God on a daily basis? How much do I
          really study the Bible? What questions do I have about God/my
          faith/the Bible?

        <p className="h3">CREATING A LIFE PLAN</p>

        <p className="h4">STEP 3: Find accountability and support</p>

        <p>
          Although your Life Plan is a very PERSONAL thing, staying on track
          requires ACCOUNTABILITY and SUPPORT.
        </p>
        <p>
          Accountability is necessary because we are far too good at making
          EXCUSES to ourselves. When we have no accountability, we make small
          ALLOWANCES that become big allowances. Before we know it, we find
          ourselves farther away from our destination than when we started.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we set out on our Life Plan, we also need SUPPORT. Support is
          important for curveball planning, as we will see in the next section,
          and for STRENGTH. Support comes in a variety of ways. There is
          emotional support, spiritual support, physical support, and financial
          support.
        </p>
        <p>
          Emotional supporters are always just a phone call away. They are great
          listeners, show unconditional empathy, and aren’t afraid to give you
          truth, no matter how unpleasant it may be.
        </p>
        <p>
          Spiritual supporters are those that encourage you in your faith. They
          are prayer partners and will do everything in their power to make sure
          you are growing in Christ.
        </p>
      </Container>
      <Container className="my-5">
        <p>
          Physical supporters are those that are there to help with physical
          needs. They are there if you have a flat tire, need an emergency
          babysitter, or you have a leaky faucet in the middle of the night.
        </p>

        <p>
          Financial support is found by having plans in place if you were to
          fall on financially hard times. This support can be an accessible line
          of emergency credit, parents who would help get you back on your feet
          in a crisis, or community resources you could accesses if you found
          yourself in need.

        <p className="h4">Steps to Accountability and Support</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            On the next page in your Life Plan journal, write the word
            ACCOUNTABILITY on the top of the page. On the following page, write
            the word SUPPORT.
          </li>
          <li>
            Under “Accountability”, divide your paper into 8 different SECTIONS.
            Label those sections “Personal Accountability”, “Financial
            Accountability”, “Parenting Accountability”, “Relationship
            Accountability”, “Health Accountability”, “Career Accountability”,
            “Educational Accountability”, and “Spiritual Accountability”.
          </li>
          <li>
            In each section, list at least 2 ways you will be held accountable
            to your goals in that category. For financial accountability, maybe
            you cut up your credit card so you are no longer able to use it. Or,
            have a financially savvy friend look over your bank statements every
            month. For health accountability, consider joining a health support
            group or only buying groceries online so you don’t impulse buy junk
            food.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the page labeled “SUPPORT,” create 4 sections on the page. Label
            these sections “Emotional Support”, “Spiritual Support”, “Physical
            Support”, “Financial Support”.
          </li>
          <li>
            In each section, list 2 people or organizations that you can count
            on for support in these categories. Examples will be listed on the

        <p className="h4">STEP 4: Curveball Planning</p>

        <p>
          The FINAL PHASE of creating a Life Plan is to plan for the unexpected.
          Life is full of TWISTS and TURNS. If we are not careful, these twist
          and turns can send us spiraling out of control. But when we can
          ANTICIPATE some of these curveballs and PLAN for them accordingly, we
          are far less likely to find ourselves in a crisis.
        </p>
        <p>
          Curveballs can literally hit us in ANY area of our life. Planning for
          every potential CURVEBALL is not realistic but if we can create
          curveball plans for MAJOR areas of our life and those with the
          potential to be most devastating, we have the greatest chance for
          SUCCESS.
        </p>
        <p>
          The areas that we will focus on in our Life Plan journal will be as
          follows:

        <ul>
          <li>Relationships/Family</li>

        <p className="h5">Relationships/Family</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            If my boyfriend and I broke up, I would want my child to spend the
            week with me and the weekends with my partner. I would definitely
            need help with child support but I know he would be unreliable so I
            would have to be able to survive without it. We would probably have
            to split everything in the house since we purchased it together so I
            would have to be prepared to purchase some household items. I know
            my boyfriend’s name is on the lease so if we broke up I would have
            to live with my parents until I found a new place.
          </li>
          <li>
            If I got pregnant again, I know I couldn’t afford another child. I
            don’t know much about the Safe Haven Law so I want to spend some
            time researching it. I have thought about adoption, but I don’t know
            much about it. I will contact a local adoption agency so I have a
            better understanding of what that looks like.
          </li>
          <li>
            My friend had to get away from her husband because he was violent.
            She told me about Peaceful Pastures. I will get some information
            from them to have in case my boyfriend ever becomes too aggressive.
          </li>
          <li>
            I don’t have a WILL. I need to contact a lawyer to help me draw one
            up. I know I want my child to live with my mom and step-dad,
            definitely not my dad and step-mom.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p className="h5">Health</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            I have insurance through so I would have a lot of help with my
            medical bills should I become ill. I don’t have disability
            insurance. I will ask my employer if they offer that and how much it
            costs. I have heard it is affordable.
          </li>
          <li>
            If I became really ill, I know my mom and step-dad could help care
            for my child. I know that Nancy, my next door neighbor would be
            willing to take my child to and from school each day.
          </li>
          <li>
            I take vitamins every day and work out so I feel like I am
            preventing a lot of health complications with those habits. However,
            I know I need to quite smoking because I have seen the damage it can
            cause. I also plan to stay away from people at work who drink so I
            can continue my sobriety and not be tempted to fall into my old
            ways.

            My resume is old and outdated. I will update my resume this week and
            will update it every 3-months so I am prepared if I should ever lose
            my current job.
          </li>
          <li>
            I know my monthly budget, thanks to my accounting friend. To keep up
            my current lifestyle, I need to make a minimum of $19/hr
            ($40,000/year). However, I know there are some places I could cut my
            budget. I could cancel cable, I could lower my cell phone bill by
            choosing a lower plan, I could stop eating out, and I could carpool
            to work to save money on gas. If I made these cuts, I could survive
            on $14/hr ($30,000/year). I couldn’t accept a ob that paid any less
            than that.
          </li>
          <li>
            I just started putting money away in my savings account. I have some
            sick time at work but if that ran out, I could afford to take 4 days
            of unpaid time off. I really need to get more money in my savings
            account in case I need to take more days of unpaid time off in case
            my child is ill or I have any other type of major life event.

          You have done A LOT of great work creating a Life Plan. Be sure to
          keep this plan “ALIVE” by keeping it updated and by holding yourself
          ACCOUNTABLE to it. This is a life you desire; a good, SUCCESSFUL life.
          It is achievable if you WORK hard and visit this plan OFTEN to keep it
          fresh in your mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Don’t allow yourself to get distracted by TEMPORARY things. This is a
          MARATHON, not a sprint. Taking this Life Plan from DESIGN to
          DESTINATION is a long journey. Don’t get discouraged; remember to
          CELEBRATE the small victories along the way.
