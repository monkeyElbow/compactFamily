              <h4>EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR</h4>
              <p>
                Jay Mooney became the Executive Director of COMP
                <strong>ACT</strong> Family Services in 2012. After serving as
                the National Youth Director for the Assemblies of God for 7
                years, Jay followed God's leading to COMP<strong>ACT</strong>.
                "We do not see this transition as an abandonment of love for
                students and youth leaders," Mooney says, "God is simply
                shifting the placement of our hand upon the stem of the umbrella
                known as Assemblies of God youth ministries." God prepared him
                for this position through his experiences as well as his
                God-given passion to minister to youth and those who lead them.
                He and his wife Laura have a passion to see the youth and kids
                of today be successful and become life long followers of Christ.

              <h4>ARKANSAS DIRECTOR & ADMINISTRATOR</h4>
              <p>
                Brian Page joined COMP<strong>ACT</strong> in 2017. He has a
                rich child welfare and leadership background that will serve
                this growing agency. The role of Administrator serves directly
                under the leadership of the agency’s Executive Director.
                Regarding his new assignment as Administrator with Assemblies of
                God COMP<strong>ACT</strong> Family Services, Brian says, “In
                1993, God gave me a vision of working with vulnerable children
                and youth. In my social work career, I have had the opportunity
                to serve as a relief houseparent at Hillcrest Children’s Home,
                social services director with Pleasant Hills Children’s Home,
                and professional counselor in education and military contexts.
                Yet this new opportunity fills a vacant part of that
                life-shaping dream from almost 25 years ago. I am excited to
                work with such great people in a professional work with a
                Christ-centered culture to help redeem the fatherless and family
                need in this world. Sharon and I are humbled to join COMPACT in
                this vision and mission.”
