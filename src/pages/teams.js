              Mission Teams are one of our biggest assets to advance COMP
              <strong>ACT</strong>â€™s care, ministry, facilities and outreach.
              Mission Teams are welcome throughout the year, but most come
              during summer or other school breaks. Mission Teams do a variety
              of things from maintenance projects/cleaning/painting, putting
              together activities for kids and helping with events we have on
              campus. Teams also bring a variety of people: pastors, painters,
              carpenters, photographers, teachers, and so many more. Know that
              whoever you bring on your team will be an asset to us!
