          Week 6 - ALL ABOUT ACES…AND PARENTING TO PREVENT THEM
        </p>
        <p className="lead">
          What are ACES and how do they impact our lives and the lives of our
          children?

        <p className="h3">WHAT ARE ACES</p>
        <p>
          ACES are a set of 10 ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES(traumatic events)
          that have been studied and shown to contribute to HEALTH problems and
          a DECREASED quality of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          These traumatic events can create something called “TOXIC STRESS”
          which can increase problems with learning and memory, weaken a child’s
          IMMUNE system, lower a child’s TOLERANCE for stress, and can
          contribute to many OTHER physical and mental health problems.

        <p>45% of America’s CHILDREN have experienced at least 1 ACE</p>
        <p>
          1 out of every 10 children has EXPERIENCED 3+ ACES, making them “high
          risk”
        </p>
        <p>
          Arkansas has the HIGHEST average ACES score out of the entire country
          with a reported 56% of CHILDREN having experienced at least 1 ACE

        <p className="h3">THE GOOD NEWS</p>
        <p>
          Although nearly HALF of all children have experienced or will
          experience at least 1 Adverse Childhood Experience, the GOOD news is
          that ACES can be PREVENTED AND children can successfully HEAL from ACE
          trauma.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember, even with your BEST prevention efforts, some children will
          still experience traumatic events. However, PURPOSEFUL parenting can
          help HEAL these wounds and bring restoration to these children.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you scored HIGH on the ACES quiz, this doesn’t mean you are doomed
          to a sad life and poor health. It MEANS that you may have some of your
          OWN healing to do before you can successfully help your child(ren)
          heal from THEIR own ACES.

        <p className="h3">HEALING TRAUMA FROM ACES</p>
        <p>
          As a parent, it is important to IMMEDIATELY respond in a healthy and
          nurturing way if your child has experienced TRAUMA. Research has shown
          that by building RESILIENCE in children, they can combat the NEGATIVE
          effects of toxic stress.
        </p>
        <p>
          Resilience means knowing how to SOLVE problems and how to build and
          maintain HEALTHY relationships. As parents, it is our job to MODEL
          resilience to our children and GUIDE them in their resilience
          development.

        <p className="h3">BUILDING RESILIENCE</p>
        <p>Here are some steps to take to help children build resilience</p>
        <p>Be supportive</p>

        </ul>
        <p>Help children build social connections</p>
        <ul>

            Allow children the opportunity to socialize with peers and other

          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Make sure their basic needs are met</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Help your child know that they will always have food and water
          </li>
          <li>
            Ask your child ways you can help them feel safe (locks on doors, a
            nightlight, etc)
          </li>
          <li>
            Find a good therapist for your child to help nurture their emotional
            health
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Model healthy relationship practices</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Say sorry</li>

          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Move and Play</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Teach kids healthy coping strategies such as dancing, running,
            punching a pillow, or taking a calm bath when they need to reduce
            stress
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Teach kids to identify and express emotions</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Help kids build their emotional vocabulary by naming and practicing
            emotions or by using an emotions chart
          </li>
          <li>
            Give your child a journal and ask them to draw a picture of how they
            felt throughout the day
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Build time for rest</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Provide children with opportunities to “cool down” in a safe, warm
            place when needed
          </li>
          <li>
            Make sure children get plenty of sleep/rest (this helps the brain
            heal)
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Be present</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Listen and respond patiently to children</li>
          <li>Make eye contact when communicating with your child</li>
        </ul>
      </Container>
      <Container className="my-5">
        <p>
          When we help children build resilience, we can take TOXIC stress and
          turn it into TOLERABLE stress.
        </p>
        <p>
          Resilience, then, acts like a BUFFER to potential TOXIC stress
          situations and acts as a PREVENTION tool in the future!
