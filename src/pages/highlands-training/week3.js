        <p className="h3">Week 3 - SELF-CARE</p>
        <p className="lead">
          In this lesson we will learn how to consistently implement self-care
          in our lives. As we discover who we are in Christ, we also discover
          how he helps us take care of ourselves mentally, physically,
          spiritually, and emotionally.

        <p className="h3">WHAT IS SELF-CARE?</p>
        <p>
          The literal dictionary definition says, “self-care is the practice of
          taking an ACTIVE role in PROTECTING one’s own well-being”
        </p>
        <p className="px-3">
          - Notice that self-care isn’t something that happens naturally in our
          lives, it is something we must be ACTIVE in doing! Doing so PROTECTS
          ourselves from deterioration, much like getting regular oil changes
          and car washes protect your car.
        </p>
        <p>
          Self-care is the opposite of business. It’s not just something else to
          add to your “to-do” list. In fact, if it feels like a burden, it isn’t
          self-care at all.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          However, as stated above, it IS something you have to be PROACTIVE and
          INTENTIONAL about doing. It can be a delicate balance but start small.
          It will eventually become a healthy habit you find yourself doing
          naturally.

        <p className="h3">WHY DO WE TALK ABOUT SELF-CARE FIRST?</p>

        <p>
          If you ever have ever travelled by plane, you have probably heard the
          flight attendant say that in case of an emergency, oxygen masks will
          drop from above your seat. If that happens, they advise you to put
          YOUR mask on first BEFORE helping your kids, spouse, or neighbor. Why
          do you think they say this? It’s because if YOU aren’t ok, you are of
          NO HELP to anyone else.
        </p>

        <p>
          The same principle applies in life. If YOU aren’t ok, you can’t
          effectively help others; and in some cases, you may end up doing more
          DAMAGE than good.
        </p>
        <p>
          Self-care can be hard, especially for moms. Parents, especially moms,
          are always tending to someone else’s needs. However, if we NEGLECT
          ourselves on a regular basis, we become less and less able to
          adequately meet the emotional, physical, and spiritual needs of our
          kids.

      <Container className="my-5">
        <p className="h3">WHY IS SELF-CARE IMPORTANT?</p>
        <p>Self-care ends up helping our kids just as much as it helps us.</p>
        <p>
          Simply put, you can’t GIVE what you don’t HAVE. You need to have
          energy to give energy. You need to FEEL peace to PROVIDE a peaceful
          atmosphere. You need to heal before you can help you children heal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Self-care ISN’T selfish, it isn’t a luxury, it is absolutely
          NECESSARY. If we are not INTENTIONAL about finding time for self-care,
          our bodies, minds, and spirits will begin to deteriorate until we are
          FORCED to pause and re-set, often due to sickness, depression, and/or
          anxiety.

        <p className="h3">WHAT DOES THE BIBLE SAY ABOUT SELF-CARE?</p>
        <p>
          Although it is easy to mark self-care as selfish or unimportant,
          self-care is a BIBLICAL principle. God knew how important self-care
          was but also how HARD it would be. So, He took several opportunities
          to address it in the Bible. Look at the following examples found in
          scripture:
        </p>
        <p>
          The FIRST example of self-care we see in the Bible is literally in the
          opening chapters of Genesis. After God created the world, He took an
          ENTIRE day to rest and reflect on His masterpiece. If God, an all
          powerful, immortal, and holy being took time to REST, how much more
          important is it for US? (Genesis 2:2)
        </p>
        <p>
          In the very next book of the Bible, God actually puts the very
          practice He modeled for us into LAW. In Exodus, God COMMANDS that the
          people of Israel are to work 6 days but are to rest, to do NO work, on
          the seventh day in order to be REFRESHED. (Exodus 23:12)

        <p className="h3">WHAT DOES THE BIBLE SAY ABOUT SELF-CARE?</p>
        <p>
          Elijah was a great prophet and had experienced God do MANY miracles
          through him. However, when a queen threatened to kill him, Elijah
          became so AFRAID and so ANXIOUS that he had a nervous breakdown.
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact, he was sleeping so soundly that an angel of the Lord had to
          WAKE him up. When he woke up, God gave him FOOD for his hungry belly.
          Then, God put him right back to SLEEP. God knew how much our bodies
          effect our MINDS and our SPIRITS. Elijah was so tired and ”hangry”
          that he couldn’t think clearly. Once Elijah woke up AGAIN, God told
          him to re-engage in his PURPOSE. Elijah was able to get BACK UPand go
          forward, stronger than before, because he had taken care of HIMSELF.
          (1 Kings 19:5-18)
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember, your body is the TEMPLE of the Holy Spirit! God’s spirit
          lives in YOU and you have a RESPONSIBILITY to care for your body, your
          mind, and your spirit so that you can live up to your FULL potential
          and walk in God’s PURPOSE for your life. (1 Corinthians 6:19-20)
