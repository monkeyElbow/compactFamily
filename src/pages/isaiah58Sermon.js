            In Isaiah 58:1-2 the LORD tells Isaiah, (1)“Cry aloud; do not hold
            back; lift up your voice like a trumpet; declare to my people their
            transgression, to the house of Jacob their sins. (2) Yet they seek
            me daily and delight to know my ways, as if they were a nation that
            did righteousness and did not forsake the judgment of their God;
            they ask of me righteous judgments; they delight to draw near to
            God.”
          </p>
          <p>
            In Isaiah 58:3 the people who seek the LORD, but on their terms and
            not His, say to the LORD - ‘Why have we fasted, and You see it not?
            Why have we humbled ourselves, and You take no knowledge of it?’
            Behold, in the day of your fast you seek your
            own pleasure [business] and oppress all your workers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Isaiah 58:4 continues, …Fasting like yours this day will not make
            your voice to be heard on high.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Isaiah 58:6-7 God declares the kind of fast He chooses, (6) “Is
            not this the fast that I choose; to loose he bonds of wickedness, to
            undo the straps of the yoke, to let the oppressed [bruised] go free,
            and to break every yoke? (7) Is it not to share your bread with the
            hungry and bring the homeless poor into your house; when you see the
            naked to cover him and not to hide yourself from your own flesh?”
          </p>
          <div className="px-5">
            <p>
              The words oppressed, yoke[d], hungry, homeless,
              poor, and naked are all used in Scripture in relation to the
              fatherless and orphan. In fact, all those words typify a foster
              child. Foster children are:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Oppressed by the yoke of family brokenness and abuse.</li>
              <li>Hungry from neglect and poverty.</li>
              <li>
                Homeless when they are removed and abandoned from their home due
                to abuse, neglect and poverty.
              </li>
              <li>
                Naked when they often have just the clothes on their bodies when
                they become homeless; sometimes they have a garbage bag with a
                couple changes of clothes.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              All these words of underdogs as found in Isaiah 58:6-7 typify the
              children and youth we serve at AG COMP

            <p>
              The 58th chapter of Isaiah is not the first time the LORD has
              emphasized the importance of righteousness and justice for kids.
              In Isaiah 1:15-17 we read, (15) When you spread out your hands, I
              will hide my eyes from you; even though you make many prayers, I
              will not listen; your hands are full of blood. (16) Wash
              yourselves; make yourselves clean; remove the evil of your deeds
              from before my eyes; cease to do evil, learn to do good; seek
              justice, correct oppression; bring justice to the fatherless,
              plead the widow’s cause.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            Then in the seven remaining verses of Isaiah 58:8-14 we read what
            God promises to those who fast and pray for His business…
          </p>
          <div className="px-5">
            <p>
              Isaiah 58:8 promises, Then shall your light break forth like the
              dawn, and your healing shall spring up speedily; your
              righteousness shall go before you; the glory of the LORD shall be
              your rear guard.
            </p>
            <p>
              Isaiah 58:9 continues, Then you shall call, and the LORD will
              answer, you shall cry, and he will say, ‘Here I am.’ If you take
              away the yoke from your midst, the pointing of finger, and
              speaking wickedness, 
            </p>
            <p>
              Isaiah 58:10 reminds again, if your pour yourself out for the
              hungry and satisfy the desire of the afflicted, then shall your
              light rise in the darkness and your gloom be as the noonday.
            </p>
            <p>
              Isaiah 58:11 extends the promise, And the LORD will guide you
              continually and satisfy your desire in scorched places and make
              your bones strong; and you shall be like a watered garden, like a
              spring of water, whose waters do not fail.
            </p>
            <p>
              Yet God’s promise extends farther as Isaiah 58:12 says, And your
              ancient ruins shall be rebuilt; you shall raise up the foundations
              of many generations; you shall be called the repairer of the
              breach, the restorer of streets to dwell in.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the remaining two verses of Isaiah 58, God summarizes the
              overall message one again, (13) ‘If you turn back your foot from
              the Sabbath, from doing your pleasure [business] on my holy day,
              and call the Sabbath a delight and the holy day of the LORD
              honorable; if you honor it, not going your own ways, or seeking
              your own pleasure, or talking idly; (14) then you shall take
              delight in the LORD, and I will make you ride on the heights of
              the earth; I will feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father,
              for the mouth of the LORD has spoken.”
