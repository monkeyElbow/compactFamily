            Interview with Fredrick Joseph McCoart III ‘Joe’ and Brenda McCoart,
            adoptive parents of “Gabe,” a young boy.
          </strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          Tammy Nelson served as the Hillcrest nurse during Gabe’s time at
          Hillcrest. Nelson connected with and ministered to Gabe, helping him
          heal from abuse and neglect and find a forever home. Often cords of
          compassion are connected beyond a single person or moment. As such,
          God’s redeeming grace extends from generation to generation.{" "}
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>
            Joe, tell us a little bit of your background and how you got
            connected with Gabe:
          </strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Joe:</strong> “I was 61 and my wife was 52 at the time of our
          adoption. If you would have told me that I would be adopting a little
          boy at 61, I would have thought you were crazy. We have four
          grandkids!”{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Brenda:</strong> “How we got connected with Gabe is pure
          divine intervention. My aunt is Gabe’s great grandmother.
          Unfortunately, she passed away in October of 2018. Gabe’s caseworker
          brought him to the funeral as he had spent a good deal of time in her
          care. Following the funeral, Gabe just came up to me and hugged my
          neck. It was like something was ignited inside of me. I didn’t know
          what it was but my eyes immediately filled with tears. Later that
          night, the Lord woke me up out of my sleep and I felt Him asking me to
          care for Gabe. I didn’t know what that meant but I knew I had to be
          there for him. I knew if it was the Lord’s will, Joe’s heart was going
          to have to be softened to the idea. The next day when I told Joe what
          I was feeling, tears started running down his cheeks and he asked what
          we needed to do to get Gabe in our care.”
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>
            So, what was the process like getting Gabe to your home?
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Joe:</strong> “All we knew was that we had to get this done.
          We drove 2 ½ hours each way to see Gabe two to 3 times a week. We
          would take him to dinner or just have an evening visit, but we were so
          drawn to him we knew we had to bring him home. It was an instant
          love.”
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Brenda:</strong> “A few days after the funeral, we hired an
          attorney to get things started. We knew we were supposed to adopt him.
          We continually saw that it was the Lord’s perfect timing. I remember
          that at one of our first visits with Gabe, I asked why he hugged me
          like he did at the funeral. Gabe replied, ‘It was because you sang
          such a pretty song.’”
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Joe:</strong> “Through this period of time, we just kept
          thinking that the adoption couldn’t come soon enough. Once Gabe was in
          our home as a foster placement, his Sunday School teacher told us that
          he had asked for prayer that his adoption would come through and come
          through soon. This gave us a peace that, despite all the
          circumstances, Gabe would be happy in our home.”

            How have you seen Gabe grow since the adoption in Feb. 2019?
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Joe:</strong> “Despite everything Gabe has been through, he
          remains very caring toward others. He’s very smart and polite. I know
          that Hillcrest really helped Gabe develop a strong spiritual life. He
          also is just so content. He doesn’t look like the same boy. He is
          happy. He loves family. He even started calling us mom and dad almost
          immediately.”

          <em>During Gabe’s first Christmas at Hillcrest, </em>COMP
          <strong>ACT</strong>
          <em>
            Executive Director, Jay Mooney witnessed Gabe receiving a helicopter
            toy from a giving church group. He squealed with joy and then
            immediately turned to share his gift with another boy. Jay said,
            “There is something extra special about Gabe. How does a boy suffer
            so much and yet care so much for others? He doesn’t see himself
            first. He sees others.” Shortly thereafter, Jay again witnessed Gabe
            sharing generously during Shop-with-a-Sherriff, a Hillcrest event in
            partnership with local businesses and the county sheriff’s office.
            Children were given gift cards to shop with. They can buy anything
            they want so long as they buy something for another child, even if
            it’s just some candy. Gabe immediately took a sheriff and another
            boy and bought the boy a helicopter, just like his.{" "}
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Brenda:</strong> “Gabe wanted his middle name changed to match
          his new daddy. He loves me but he REALLY loves Joe, he needed a
          father.”
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            How did COMP<strong>ACT</strong> support you in your journey?
          </strong>
          <strong>Brenda:</strong> “COMP<strong>ACT</strong> Hillcrest gave Gabe
          the foundation he has. They instilled a great deal of who God is into
          Gabe and it has made a huge difference. I’m so thankful for COMP
          <strong>ACT</strong>. Without them we wouldn’t have our little boy.”
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Joe:</strong> “COMP<strong>ACT</strong> gave us great advice
          throughout our journey. Gabe is continually telling us what life was
          like at COMPACT. Whatever COMPACT is doing with these kids, it is
          making a huge difference in these children.”{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>How would you encourage future adoptive parents? </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Joe:</strong> “So many kids need a good home and there are so
          many good homes out there. Keep moving forward. The process can be
          overwhelming, but it is so worth it.”
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Brenda:</strong> “You have to know this is what you want and
          what God has for you. If you do, you will see that God will be with
          you. It won’t be easy but keep praying, it is well worth it.”
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What kind of support do you have?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Brenda:</strong> “Our kids and family are very supportive.
          They are more than happy to do whatever they can to help. Gabe is
          surrounded by our family as well as our church family. Joe and I are
          always making new friends because of Gabe. Our world is growing, and
          it is all thanks to our precious boy.”

          <strong>
            I was a lost, broken 7-year-old when my Hillcrest story began. No
            one should ever have to go through what I went through. But who
            would have thought that a broken, empty little 7-year-old would turn
            out to have a story worthy of sharing?
          </strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          My journey started when I was 2 years old with the divorce of my
          parents. When my parents split, we moved into public housing with my
          mother. My mother knew that we needed to develop a relationship with
          Jesus, thus we were very active in our church. I even eventually
          joined my church’s choir. Then one day, as quickly as a summer storm
          rolls across the sky, the clouds of my life began to turn gray.{" "}
        </p>

        <p>
          My mother always wanted the best for my sister and me. She promised us
          that she would always do anything in her power to make sure we had the
          best chance for success, no matter what the cost. She had big dreams
          and bright goals for us, but she knew she couldn’t help us reach our
          full potential on her own.
        </p>

        <p>
          Knowing she needed help, my home church told my mom about Hillcrest
          Children’s Home. Mom spent much time in prayer and, one day, asked,
          “Would you girls rather live with your father or go to this children’s
          home?” My sister said, “Mama, we want to go to the children’s home.”
          Finally, in January of 2005, with the help of our church and the DHS
          system, my Hillcrest story began.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the young age of 7, I didn’t understand anything that was going on.
          All I wanted was to be with my mother. Sometimes I would get so angry
          and upset that my parents didn’t want me that I would get on my bike
          and leave the campus.
        </p>
        <p>
          As time passed and I got older, my mother began to come back into my
          life. However, the longer I was at Hillcrest, the more I began to
          learn and understand that Hillcrest would be the place I called home
          until I graduated high school.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          While living at Hillcrest, I attended Lakeside School District all the
          way through my senior year. Although I was at Hillcrest, I always
          wanted to be an athlete; I wanted to be more than “that girl that
          lives in the children’s home”. I joined track, volleyball, basketball,
          and cheerleading. As an extracurricular activity, I joined band where
          I played the clarinet, saxophone, and bass clarinet. I always stayed
          busy with my sports and academics to keep my mind off my family who, I
          knew, was going through a hard time themselves.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Although I was in many other sports, cheerleading became my passion. I
          was blessed to have a coach that was way more than a coach to me, she
          was my advisor, support system, and my personal cheerleader. Lakeside
          cheer, and all the girls on the team, became family to me.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          rowing up at Hillcrest with many other children who had the similar
          stories to mine was an experience I will never forget. Many of the
          girls who were in my house eventually became family and to this very
          same day, we maintain a sisterhood/brotherhood bond that no one will
          understand or ever be able to take away. As I matured, I started to
          see everything more clearly and the plan that God had for my life. I
          began to open myself up to the staff and the different house parents
          on campus, from “mom” and “dad” to “nay-nay” and “Papaw”.

        <p>
          I graduated Lakeside High School May 2016. I had a 3.45 GPA and I was
          top 50% in my class. I was also offered cheerleading scholarships from
          3 different colleges. I wanted to continue the passion I had for
          cheer, but I also wanted to start thinking about my future and what
          and who I wanted to be. After touring campuses back to back, I made
          the decision that in August 2016 I would start my freshman year at
          Henderson State University.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          When my mother was a little girl, she always knew what college she
          wanted to attend. Unfortunately, she never got the chance to attend
          her dream college which was, in fact, Henderson State University.
          Because my mother never got to attend Henderson, she helped put me
          through her dream school and it always brings such a smile to her
          face.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          I am now a senior at Henderson State University, and I am graduating
          May 2020 with a Bachelor’s Degree in Human Services/ Social Work and a
          minor in Sociology. I am an active member of a Zeta Phi Beta Sorority
          Inc. and an active member of the Black Student Association. My plans
          are to get my Masters in Social Work and become a Child and Family
          Mental and Abuse Substance social worker to help kids, just like
          Hillcrest helped me.
