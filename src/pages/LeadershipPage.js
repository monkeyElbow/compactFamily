                ®  Family Services is excited to announce the appointment of Alan Bixler, DSL, MOL, as its new Executive Director. Alan will
                replace Rev. Jay Mooney, who served from 2012-2022, as the
                ministry’s Executive Director. 
              </p>
              <p>
                The search for a new Executive Director was led by Board
                Chairman and Assistant General Superintendent, Rev. Rick DuBose.
                Rev. Dubose and the COMP
                <span className="act">ACT</span>®  Board spent the last few months considering candidates,
                interviewing, and praying for the right individual to fill this
                strategic role. “Alan comes to us with a wealth of experience
                when it comes to leadership and strategic community endeavors.
                The professional expertise he brings will help bring about great
                execution in the future of this ministry,” stated Rev. Rick
                DuBose.
              </p>
              <p>
                Alan and Heather Bixler served as Lead Pastors at Crosswalk
                Community Church, in Sioux Falls, SD for the last eight years.
                They will base their ministry out of Hot Springs, AR and are
                currently in the process of purchasing a home. This is not the
                first assignment for the Bixler’s in the Hot Springs area. They
                have roots having served as youth pastors at what is now called,
                Legacy Church. It was during this time that Alan was able to
                minister to the residents of Hillcrest in his youth ministry.
              </p>
              <p>
                The juncture of this assignment culminates the influences of
                Alan’s life, ministry, and educational experience. Alan has over
                31 years of ministry and outreach influence, resulting in
                various leadership specialties, targeted demographics, and a
                broad scope of industries involving both church and corporate
                opportunities.
              </p>
              <p>
                Alan added, “It is an honor to accept the position of Executive
                Director of COMP
                <span className="act">ACT</span>®  Family Services. I covet your prayers in continuing to
                fulfill the nearly 78-year mission to be a Christ- centered

                 Family Services, Brian says, “In 1993, God gave me a vision of
                working with vulnerable children and youth. In my social work
                career, I have had the opportunity to serve as a relief
                houseparent at Hillcrest Children’s Home, social services
                director with Pleasant Hills Children’s Home, and professional
                counselor in education and military contexts. Yet this new
                opportunity fills a vacant part of that life-shaping dream from
                almost 25 years ago. I am excited to work with such great people
                in a professional work with a Christ-centered culture to help
                redeem the fatherless and family need in this world. I am
                humbled to join COMP
