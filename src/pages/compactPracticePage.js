The CompaCare Practice is an evidence-informed wraparound model that puts the foster family in the center, with different levels of volunteer support.  Some volunteers will provide goods and services and would not have direct contact with foster children (grey circles).  Some volunteers provide valuable direct services, especially critical support services such as respite, transport, and baby-sitting services (purple circles).  Two types of volunteers are tasked with operations management (blue circles), the CompaCare Church Leader and a number of Family Advocates who coordinate the needs of the family with the various services available in the church (the volunteers) and the community (red circle).  The secret of the success of the CompaCare Practice Model is the role of the Family Advocate.  They provide the emotional, spiritual, and tangible support resources that help the foster parents feel that they are not alone in their ministry.  Trained CompaCare Representatives are deployed throughout the country to provide technical support and help in the training of Family Advocates for local churches.
