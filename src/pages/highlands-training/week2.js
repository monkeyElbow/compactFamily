        <p className="lead">
          God has a plan and purpose for us. The most important way we can learn
          to be healthy is to see ourselves through God’s eyes. Here we will
          learn how to seek out our god-given identity and understand who He
          says we are.

        <p className="h3">INTRODUCTION</p>
        <p className="lead">
          The first step to being a great parent is being confident in yourself
          and in your true, God-given identity. As an introduction to learning
          your REAL name, your REAL identity, please watch the following video:

        <p>
          What a powerful video! I love the part where she reminds us that God
          knew we would be called “the wrong name” so He took time in His Word
          to remind us of our REAL name! Before we can start walking by our REAL
          name, we have to identify and recognize that we have been answering to
          the WRONG name. I want you to take 5-10 minutes to write down WRONG
          names that you have answered to. When you’re done, I want you to rip
          up the piece of paper and ask God to reveal your NEW name; your REAL
          name(s). When you feel God bring a word, a name, to mind, I want you
          to write it down. Your assignment this week will utilize this name so
          make sure it is written in a place you won’t forget about it.

        <p className="h3">Step 2: KNOW YOUR WORTH</p>
        <p>
          Once you realize WHO you are…once you realize what your name REALLY
          is, the Enemy will try to tell you that you are not worthy of that new
          name. He will try to convince you that the name God gave you couldn’t
          POSSIBLY be your name; that you weren’t good enough to have THAT name.
        </p>
        <p>
          Watch the sermon in the link below that will help you see just how
          much you are worth!

        <p className="h3">Step 3: WEAR YOUR NEW NAME</p>
        <p>
          The hardest part of your identity journey will be walking CONFIDENTLY
          in your NEW name. When friends and family try to remind you of your
          OLD name, hold on to God’s definition of who you are IN HIM.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you start to feel anxious, remember that God calls you a VICTOR,
          He calls you INVINCIBLE. When you start to feel unwanted, remember
          that God calls you LOVED and VALUED. When you feel depressed, remember
          that God has called you an OVERCOMER.

        <p className="h3">Step 4: GET BACK UP!</p>
        <p>
          There will be COUNTLESS times that you find yourself responding to and
          living in your OLD name. You may start to feel defeated as you find
          yourself weighed down time and time again by who you USED to be. There
          is an incredible, INCREDIBLE verse in the Bible that says EVERYONE
          falls; everyone fails. The difference between the RIGHTEOUS (God’s
          redeemed; God’s children) and the UNRIGHTEOUS is that the righteous
          GET BACK UP!
