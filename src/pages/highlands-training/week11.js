        <p>
          The CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) states that good
          NUTRUTION during the first 2 years of live is “VITAL for healthy
          growth and development”. But getting babies, and especially toddlers,
          to eat much of ANYTHING, let alone nutritious food, can be HARDER than
          it sounds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kids are SO picky! But if you know the benefits of good nutrition AND
          are armed with some tools to help make HEALTHY eating more “fun”, you
          will be able to give your children a jump start on healthy BODIES and
          healthy BRAINS.

        <p className="ps-4">
          Nationally, only 2% of children meet the USDA Food Guide Pyramid

        <p className="ps-4">
          Only 22% of kids in the US eat the recommended 5 or more servings of

        <p className="h3">GETTING KIDS TO EAT HEALTHY</p>

        <p>
          Kids can be super PICKY eaters! The most important thing to remember
          is not to make mealtime STRESSFUL. The more RELAXED you are, the more
          relaxed (and open to new food) your kiddos will be. Here are some tips
          for getting kids to eat HEALTHY:
        </p>

        <p>
          Offer choices – let kids feel in control of their plates. Try having 2
          vegetables/2 fruits to pick from at each meal. Letting them feel
          empowered goes a long way with kids who are trying new things.
        </p>

        <p>
          Snack small – offering small, frequent, and healthy snacks throughout
          the day helps kids stay hungry for meals but also allows them to try a
          variety of healthy foods in unintimidating portions throughout the
          day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lead by example – young children, especially toddlers, will want to
          eat things that you are eating. If you are making healthy choices,
          your children will be more apt to try the same foods.
        </p>
        <p>
          Make it fun – serving bright, bold colors cut into cute shapes (maybe
          with cookie cutters) is a great way to take the “scary” out of new
          foods. Try this look for some “FUN” food ideas:

          Another component to keeping KIDS healthy is PHYSICAL activity.

          {" "}
          The US Department of Health and Senior Services makes the following
          recommendations regarding physical activity:
        </p>

        <p>60 minutes or more of PHYSICAL activity a day.</p>
        <p>MUSCLE-STRENGTHENING at least 3 days a week</p>

        <p>
          So HOW in the world can we get kids moving for 60+ minutes a day?!
        </p>

        <p>Let’s look at some TIPS and TRICKS:</p>
        <p>
          Break it up – breaking up physical activity into chunks makes the. 60
          minutes+ seem much more manageable. Take a walk around the
          neighborhood for 20 minutes, you’re 1/3 of the way there!
        </p>
        <p>
          Make it fun – you don’t have to make kids do an exercise class or a
          strict workout routine to account for physical activity. Play a game
          of tag, jump on a trampoline, throw a dance party, or try one of these
          fun ideas:

          Yet another important HEALTHY habit for children is a proper amount of

          sleep can be tough!

          Helping kids go to bed at the PROPER time and get the RIGHT amount of

          Set up a bedtime ROUTINE (AND STICK TO IT!) – helping kids set up a
          PREDICTABLE routine before bed can actually help them fall asleep
          faster and stay asleep LONGER. Take a look at this ARTICLE for help
          building a bedtime routine:

        <p>
          Stay CALM – when you get frustrated at your child, you can cause your
          child to become HYPERAROUSED and/or anxious which releases ADRENALINE
          in his/her little body. Adrenaline is used in our fight or flight
          response and promotes WAKEFULNESS and it will be nearly impossible for
          a child in “fight or flight” mode to fall ASLEEP.
        </p>
        <p>
          Give some GRACE - falling asleep at a GOOD time and staying ASLEEP can
          take time. Take it SLOW and remember to have grace! Start SMALL,
          celebrate little victories, and trust the PROCESS.

          BALANCING work, your own health, schoolwork, childcare, keeping up the
          house/chores, parenting, AND keeping kids healthy can seem
          overwhelming. But the good news is, you don’t have to be perfect.
          Small, SIMPLE changes can make big differences!
        </p>

        <p>
          JOURNAL PROMPT: For your journal assignment this week, write down 12
          healthy changes you want to implement for your children. Then, number
          them in order of importance. Tackle one healthy habit per month. Small
          goals are best.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you NEVER eat vegetables, maybe you want to serve vegetables with 3
          meals a week. Maybe you want your child to NAP on the weekends. Maybe
          it is as simple as offering your child WATER with 1 meal a day instead
          of juice or soda. Like we’ve said, these seemingly small changes can
          make drastic IMPACTS in your child’s life. And, by the end of 1 year,
          you will have made HUGE gains in creating healthy habits for your
          children.
