        <p className="h3">Week 5 - HELPING KIDS NAVIGATE CHANGE</p>
        <p className="lead">
          Change can be very hard for kids. Thankfully, there are plenty of ways
          to help kids navigate change with minimal impact. This lesson will
          show us how!
        </p>
      </Container>

      <Container className="my-5">
        <p className="h3">INTRODUCTION</p>
        <p>
          Any time there is a CHANGE in life, no matter how small, there is a
          reciprocal effect on our BODIES, MINDS, and EMOTIONS.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes, especially in children, change can elicit responses which
          seem UNFITTING for the situation. For example, sometimes ANGER will be
          the outward expression, but SADNESS is the core emotion.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this lesson, we will look at how to help kids navigate CHANGE and
          PROCESS emotions in a healthy way.
        </p>
      </Container>
      <Container className="my-5">
        <p className="h3">ACKNOWLEDGE NORMAL</p>

        <p>
          The biggest thing to UNDERSTAND when it comes to kids and emotions
          during CHANGE is that big emotions are NORMAL. There is nothing wrong
          with experiencing EMOTIONS, both big and small. What we will try to do
          is HELP kids navigate these emotions and deal with them in HEALTHY
          ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tantrums and outbursts are also NORMAL when children don’t have the
          words or EMOTIONAL MATURITY to talk about what they are FEELING.
        </p>
      </Container>
      <Container className="my-5">
        <p className="h3">STEPS TO NAVIGATING CHANGE</p>
        <p>
          While change may never be a PASSIVE thing for kids, we can EASE
          transitions in kids lives by following these SIMPLE but necessary
          steps to CHANGE…
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Concentrate on Stability</li>
          <li>Help Build Vocabulary</li>
          <li>Anticipate Change</li>
          <li>Navigate Emotional Responses</li>
          <li>Give Choices (when appropriate)</li>
          <li>Experience the Good in the New</li>
        </ul>
      </Container>
      <Container className="my-5">
        <p className="h3">CONCENTRATE ON STABILITY</p>
        <p>
          Research has show that children NEED stability in their lives as much
          as they need PROTECTION and NURTURING.
        </p>
        <p>
          The CDC defines STABILITY as, “the degree of predictability and
          consistency in a child’s social, emotional, and physical ENVIRONMENT”.
        </p>
        <p>
          This means, as much as possible, parents should try to PROVIDE
          predictability and ROUTINE in their child’s everyday life.
        </p>
      </Container>
      <Container className="my-5">
        <p>
          Sometimes in life, CHANGE is inevitable; it cannot be avoided.
          However, there are things that parents can HELP children focus on when
          change becomes NECESSARY.
        </p>
        <p>
          When any CHANGE is happening in a child’s life, keep as PREDICTABLE as
          possible.
        </p>
        <p>Some examples include:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Maintaining morning/bedtime routine</li>
          <li>Continuing to serve a child’s favorite meals</li>
          <li>
            Pointing out things that are the same (such as photos on walls,
            familiar restaurants, etc.)
          </li>
          <li>Using familiar scents/candles to trigger comforting memories</li>
          <li>
            Continue celebrating special occasions/ holidays in your family’s
            traditional way(s)
          </li>
        </ul>
      </Container>
      <Container className="my-5">
        <p className="h3">HELP BUILD VOCABULARY</p>

        <p>
          Helping children NAME their emotions is an empowering way to help
          children TAME their emotions
        </p>
        <p>
          By understanding their FEELINGS, they can use their words instead of
          acting out AND they can utilize STRATEGIES to help calm that emotion
        </p>
        <p>
          To START this process, however, parents have to take an ACTIVE role in
          TEACHING their children “EMOTIONAL VOCABULARY”
        </p>
      </Container>
      <Container className="my-5">
        <p>
          A great starting resource for parents to use in building their child’s
          emotional vocabular is:

          Additionally, using ”FEELING CHARTS” such as the one on the next slide
          can help young children IDENTIFY and RECOGNIZE a variety of EMOTIONS
          instead of just happy, sad, and mad.

        <ul>
          <li>
            Here are more tips and tricks for HELPING kids learn to NAME their
            feelings:
          </li>

          <ul>
            <li>Make a list of all the feelings you can think of</li>
            <li>
              Add “noises” to each feeling (ie, a sigh could go with bored, a
              laugh could go with silly)
            </li>
            <li>
              Act out different emotions and have the other person guess what
              feeling is being portrayed
            </li>
            <li>
              Go on a feelings scavenger hunt – tell your child to find
              something that makes them tired, frustrated, excited, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              Play different instrumental songs and ask your child to describe
              how that song made them feel
            </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </Container>
      <Container className="my-5">
        <p className="h3">ANTICIPATE CHANGE</p>

        <p>
          As previously mentioned, sometimes CHANGE is unavoidable. When CHANGE
          is coming, the most IMPORTANT thing you can do for a child is
          immediately start preparing the child for that CHANGE
        </p>
        <p>
          Don’t beat around the bush – be STRAIGHTFORWARD and DIRECT with the
          child about the change coming and why the change is necessary (as age
          appropriate)
        </p>
        <p>
          Point out what will be the SAME – go back to the first point in this
          presentation…keeping as much the same as possible can help EASE your
          child’s anxiety and give them something “STABLE” to dwell on
        </p>
      </Container>
      <Container className="my-5">
        <p>
          Answer questions – your child will likely have A LOT of questions
          about the UPCOMING change. Your child may have A LOT of questions at
          once or they may ask a few questions several days/weeks in a row. Be
          PATIENT and answer the questions as THOROUGHLY as possible.
        </p>

        <p>
          Anticipate emotional reactions – your child will likely exhibit a
          variety of ATYPICAL behaviors as a result of ANXIETY. Be prepared for
          emotional OUTBURSTS and behaviors that are out of character for the
          child. Find ways to HELP your child calm down and give GRACE as they
          navigate this new season in their life
        </p>
      </Container>
      <Container className="my-5">
        <p className="h3">GIVE CHOICES</p>

        <p>
          As much as possible, ALLOWING a child to make as many CHOICES as is
          appropriate concerning the change can help ease anxiety and give
          children a sense of CONTROL in a situation where they FEEL out of
          control.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if you are moving, let the child be part of the new house
          search or let the child DECIDE how to arrange his/her room. If you are
          switching your job schedule, ask your child some things he/she would
          LIKE to build into your NEW schedule. If changing daycares/schools,
          ask your child 1 thing they would LIKE to have at their new
          daycare/school
        </p>
      </Container>
      <Container className="my-5">
        <p>
          While BIG choices may not always be appropriate, allowing your child
          to make even the smallest CHOICES has proven to be BENEFICIAL to
          children when walking through change
        </p>

        <p>
          There are MANY other benefits to allowing your child to have age
          appropriate choices concerning his/her LIFE…check out this article for
          a quick overview of the POWER of choice for a child

        <p>
          Learning to “dance in the rain” is a GOOD metaphor to keep in mind
          when NAVIGATING change with your children
        </p>
        <p>
          Even though things about the ”NEW” may not be comfortable or familiar,
          there is always an ELEMENT of good
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes the “GOOD” is very small, but it is always there…even if the
          good is SIMPLY that you and your child woke up to see another day

        <p>
          Change is HARD. Being a CHILD and navigating change is even harder.
          However, it is our JOB as parents to help guide our children through
          change in a HEALTHY way by both teaching and modeling healthy
          behavior. Ask God to give you WISDOM – He will gently guide you as
          your GUIDE your child.
