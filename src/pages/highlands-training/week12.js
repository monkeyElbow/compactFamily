        <p className="h3">THE DANGERS OF SECONDHAND SMOKE</p>
        <p className="h3">What is SECONDHAND smoke?</p>
        <p>
          According to the Environmental Protection Agency, secondhand smoke is
          a MIXTURE of the smoke given off by the burning end of a CIGARETTE,
          pipe, or cigar, and the smoke EXHALED from the lungs of a smoker.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other TERMS that may be used to DESCRIBE secondhand smoke are “ETS
          (Environmental Tobacco Smoke)”, ”passive smoking”, and “involuntary
          smoking”.
        </p>
      </Container>
      <Container className="my-5">
        <p className="h3">Why is secondhand smoke DANGEROUS?</p>
        <p>
          The CDC (Center for Disease Control) states that there are over 7,000
          CHEMICALS in secondhand smoke, hundreds of them are TOXIC and 70 of
          them cause CANCER.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since 1964, over 2.5 million NON-SMOKERS have died from problems
          caused by secondhand smoke.

        <p className="h3">CREATING A SAFE INDOOR ENVIRONMENT</p>
        <p>
          When you think about ALL the possible things babies and children can
          get into during the day or all the ways they could HURT themselves,
          baby-proofing/child-proofing your HOME can seem like a daunting task.
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          Take it SLOW and use this training as a starting place for CREATING a
          safe indoor ENVIRONMENT for your littles.
        </p>
        <p>Here are a few good TIPS to keep in mind:</p>
        <p>
          Small children DON’T understand cause-and-effect. They can’t think
          through things like, “if I pull this cord, the hot iron will fall
          down”. THREFORE, we have to think through these things FOR them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Small CHILDREN lack impulse control. If they see something that
          interests them, they can’t stay AWAY.
        </p>
        <p>
          Small children lack COORDINATION and BALANCE and can easily trip,
          slip, or fall.

          Even before a baby is born, when women are not AWARE of how to

            Every year, 3,000 babies are LOST before they have the chance to be

          <p>
            To PREVENT injury and/or death to both mom and baby, women who are
