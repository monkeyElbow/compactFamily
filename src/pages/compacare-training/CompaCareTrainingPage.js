            Welcome! You have been invited to participate in the CompaCare
            Church Leadersâ€™ Certificate Training. This course will equip you to
            lead your local church to support foster families with our
            faith-based, evidence-supported wraparound program! For several
            years now, we have been aggregating a solid supply of evidence to
            show that churches can make the difference in building capacity,
            stability, and quality in foster care! We are proud that you have
            chosen to join our team to change the way foster care is done in our
            nation!
          </p>
